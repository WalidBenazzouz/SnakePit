# Project Rules

## General Guidelines
- Use P5.js for development.
- Implement behavior patterns following Craig Reynolds' steering behaviors principles.

## Architecture & Constraints
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT modify `vehicle.js`. This file contains the base properties and behaviors for all vehicles and must remain defining the common interface.
- To implement specific behaviors or new entity types, you MUST create a subclass that extends `Vehicle`.
- Specialize and override methods like `show()`, `applyBehaviors()`, `update()`, etc., in the subclasses as needed.
